# About
This is an app to track your hobbies. It has a calendar with event tracking. A pomodoro timer, and a metronome to help you keep track of your hobbies.

# Main Structure

The **app_interface** folder contains the whole app source code. The **Resources** contains the template for the app icon so colors design can always be changed later, leading to greater flexbility. 

# Structure of App
Inside the app interface folder all our flutter widgets are stored inside the **lib** folder. There are three subfolders inside that. **models** is for the login pages that have a user model. **shared** is for shared objects that are used for the loading screen. And **widgets** is all other widgets for the app.

# How to build
